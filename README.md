# np

np is a build system for C/C++, made from scratch in Bash. Under early development; see the [planning pages](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/blob/main/_planning/np.pdf) (please note that the planned feature list could change at any time). Also see [#1](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/issues/1) (and [#2](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/issues/2), if you can help out with that).

## Help!! My terminal can't handle all the fancy formatting escape sequences in your script.

Run the script with the `-f` option.
