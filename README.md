np is a build system for C++, made from scratch in Bash. Under early development; see the [planning pages](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/blob/main/_planning/np.pdf) (please note that the planned feature list could change at any time).

## Help!! My terminal can't handle all the fancy formatting escape sequences in your script.
