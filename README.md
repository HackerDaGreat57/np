# np

np is a build system for C/C++, made from scratch in Bash. Under early development; see the [planning pages](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/blob/main/_planning/np.pdf) (please note that the planned feature list could change at any time). Also see [#1](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/issues/1) (and [#2](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/np/issues/2), if you can help out with that).

## Help!! My terminal can't handle all the fancy formatting escape sequences in your script.

I'd say that's more of a skill issue. Most shells should make everything look discolored, not literally print out the escape sequences. This is how bash 5.2 behaves On My Machineâ„¢. Coloring and formatting in the script is purely for aesthetics anyway, you'll do just fine without; it's just that a lot of us prefer half decent looking TUIs these days.

## Well guess what, my terminal doesn't support Unicode either!

Sorry, this script is not designed for use on the ENIAC.
