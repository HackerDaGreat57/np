# np

## Help!! My terminal can't handle all the fancy formatting escape sequences in your script.

Skill issue. It's 2023. Grow up.

At the ***very*** least, your shell should make everything look discolored, not literally print out the escape sequences. This is how bash 5.2 behaves On My Machineâ„¢. Coloring and formatting in the script is purely for aesthetics anyway, you'll do just fine without; it's just that a lot of us prefer half decent looking TUIs these days.

## Sorry, I don't seem to have Unicode either.

Go to bed Grandpa
